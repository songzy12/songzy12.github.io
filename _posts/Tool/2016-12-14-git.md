Basic usage of git.

## Squashing Git Commits

https://gist.github.com/patik/b8a9dc5cd356f9f6f980

```
git reset --soft HEAD~3
git commit -m "Squashing Git Commits"
```

```
git push origin +master
```

```
git log --author=songzy
git reset f7f4aec68
git log -2
git reset 7e26106
git log -2
git clean -df
git checkout -- .
```

## git reset

```
git reset <file>
```

Remove the specified file from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged.

```
git reset
```

Reset the staging area to match the most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged.

```
git reset --hard
```

Reset the staging area and the working directory to match the most recent commit.

```
git reset <commit>
```

Move the current branch tip backward to <commit>, reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone. 

```
git reset --hard <commit>

```

Move the current branch tip backward to <commit> and reset both the staging area and the working directory to match.

Whereas reverting is designed to safely undo a public commit, git reset is designed to undo local changes.

```
git add foo.py
git commit -m "Start developing a crazy feature"
git commit -a -m "Continue my crazy feature"
git reset --hard HEAD~2

```

The `git reset HEAD~2` command moves the current branch backward by two commits.

##git rebase

```
# Add the remote, call it "upstream":

git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:

git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:

git checkout master

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:

git rebase upstream/master

git push -f origin master
```

## git branch

```
git show-branch -a
```

Show branches and their commits

```
git branch <branch>
```

Create a new branch called <branch>. This does not check out the new branch.

```
git branch -d <branch>
```

Delete the specified branch.

```
git branch -D <branch>
```

Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. 

```
git branch -m <branch>
```

Rename the current branch to `<branch>`.

```
git checkout $branch2
git merge $branch1
```

Merge branch1 into branch2.

```
warning: refname 'HEAD' is ambiguous.
```

```
git branch -m HEAD temp
git branch -d temp
```

## git checkout

Give up the current modification and go back to the last commit

```
git checkout -- .
```

```
git log --oneline

b7119f2 Continue doing crazy things
872fa7e Try something crazy
a1e8fb5 Make some important changes to hello.py
435b61d Create hello.py
9773e52 Initial import
```

You can find the ID of the revision you want to see.

```
git checkout a1e8fb5
git checkout master
```

Nothing you do in here will be saved in your repository. 

```
git checkout a1e8fb5 hello.py
git checkout HEAD hello.py
```

Unlike checking out a commit, this does affect the current state of your project.

```
git status
HEAD detached From 91ea20b
```

```
git checkout source
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        source/_posts/2016-02-25-github.markdown
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can switch branches.
Aborting
```

```
git stash
git checkout source
```

## git clean

```
git clean -n
```

This will show you which files are going to be removed without actually doing it.

```
git clean -f
```

Remove untracked files from the current directory.

```
git clean -f <path>
```

Remove untracked files, but limit the operation to the specified path.

```
git clean -df
```

Remove untracked files and untracked directories from the current directory.

```
git clean -xf
```

Remove untracked files from the current directory as well as any files that Git usually ignores. 

## git clone

If you clone a repository, the default branch you have is whatever the remote's `HEAD` points to (`HEAD` is actually a symbolic ref that points to a branch name).

A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins with `ref: refs/`. For example, your `.git/HEAD` is a regular file whose contents is `ref: refs/heads/master`.

`HEAD@{1}` is always last value of `HEAD`, `ORIG_HEAD` is last value of `HEAD` before dangerous operation.

## git commit

```
git commit --amend 
```

Combine the staged changes with the previous commit and replace the previous commit with the resulting snapshot.

```
git commit -a
```

Commit all your local changes. (like `git add .` followed by `git commit`)

## git config

```
vi ~/.gitconfig
```

```
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --global user.email
```

## git diff

```
git diff filename
```

## git fetch

```
git fetch
```

Fetch all of the branches from the repository. This also downloads all of the required commits and files from the other repository.

```
git checkout master
git log origin/master
git merge origin/master
```

---

```
error: RPC failed; result=18, HTTP code = 0
```

```
git fetch origin master
git merge origin/master
```

## git format-patch 

```
$ git format-patch -o ./patches -2
0001-C.patch
0002-D.patch
```

```
git am ./patches/*
```

## git log

Check all the change paths to file `Predictor.java`.

```
git log --follow -p Predictor.java
git log -p -1
```

## git merge

```
git merge --squash <branch_name>
```

將另一個 branch 的 commit 合併為一筆，特別適合需要做實驗的 fixes bug 或 new feature，最後只留結果。合併完不會幫你先 commit。

## git pull

```
git pull <远程主机名> <远程分支名>:<本地分支名>
```

如果远程分支是与当前分支合并，则冒号后面的部分可以省略。

```
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection refused
```

```
vi ~/.ssh/config

Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
```

## git push

```
git push <远程主机名> <本地分支名>:<远程分支名>
```

```
git push origin HEAD:master
```

See the commits tab(rather than project tab). It is all there.

```
ssh -v -T songzy12@git.tsinghuax.org
```

IP filtered, move to your lab.

```
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

Server down.

## git remote

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:songzy12/certificate_predictor.git
```

## git revert

```
git revert <commit>
```

Generate a new commit that undoes all of the changes introduced in `<commit>`, then apply it to the current branch.

* it doesn’t change the project history
* it is able to target an individual commit at an arbitrary point in the history

```
git commit -m "Make some changes that will be undone"
git revert HEAD
```

## git rm

```
git rm -r --cached ".\source\_posts\Git Shell.lnk"
```

The git rm command will allows you to remote a file from git control. The –cached option to git remove allows you to leave it on your hard drive.

## git stash

```
git stash
git stash list
git stash pop
git stash clear
git stash drop
```

## fileMode

* 100644: normal file
* 100755: executable file
* 120000: symbolic link

The mode is taken from normal UNIX modes but is much less flexible – these three modes are the only ones that are valid for files (blobs) in Git (although other modes are used for directories and submodules).

The 6 digits show the file mode using the classical UNIX notations. First two digits show file type, the third one is about set-uid/set-gid/sticky bits, and you know the last three. 4\2\1 is just r\w\x.

```
man 2 stat
```

```
       S_IFLNK    0120000   symbolic link
       S_IFREG    0100000   regular file

       S_IRWXU    00700     mask for file owner permissions
       S_IRUSR    00400     owner has read permission
       S_IWUSR    00200     owner has write permission
       S_IXUSR    00100     owner has execute permission
       S_IRWXG    00070     mask for group permissions
       S_IRGRP    00040     group has read permission
       S_IWGRP    00020     group has write permission
       S_IXGRP    00010     group has execute permission
       S_IRWXO    00007     mask for permissions for others (not in group)
       S_IROTH    00004     others have read permission           
       S_IWOTH    00002     others have write permission
       S_IXOTH    00001     others have execute permission
```

To ignore file mode changes:

```
repo forall -c git config core.fileMode false
```
